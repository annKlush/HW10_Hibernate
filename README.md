# Hibernate
Task #1 - Set up the project with Hibernate: Create a new Gradle project and configure it with dependencies for H2, Hibernate, and Flyway, ensuring the project runs
without errors.

Task #2 - Write migrations for database creation and population: Create two migrations, "V1__create_db.sql" to define the database structure with tables and 
relationships, and "V2__populate_db.sql" to populate the database with sample data, including clients, planets, and tickets.

Task #3 - Create CRUD services for Client and Planet entities: Define the Client and Planet entities, map them using Hibernate annotations, and implement CRUD services,
ClientCrudService and PlanetCrudService, including unit tests to verify the functionality of all CRUD operations.
